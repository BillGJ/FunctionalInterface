# Functional Interface

This code is a simple exercise with the purpose of using
a functional interface. In short, a functional interface is
an interface containing exactly one abstract method or functional method.
In order to let the compiler identify the functional interface, 
the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation is used.

To run this code using the command line just do:
1. `javac -cp . Main.java`
2.  `java -ea -cp . Main`
